The ambient explosion system was designed so that during a battle, random,
meaningless explosions appeared throughout the battle. They serve no 
practical purpose and are really only for the visual appeal. To get this 
effect, it required some rather creative coding. If you want to see an 
example of this, download the Itano Circus mod. 

The basic idea is this. Every AI ship carries a dummy gun. The AI will see
a target, and open fire on it. When it does, the dummy gun will fire a missile
that has a short lifespan such that it explodes as it leaves the barrel. The
explosion then creates debris similar to the debris that is created when a
fighter or capital ship normally explodes. This debris is spawned at a preset
distance, and then explodes. When it explodes, you see the ambient explosion. 

First step is to get the gun itself. Here is the source code for the gun that
is used in Itano Circus. The code is commented to describe how it works and 
what it does.

This is the object that the explosions are based off of. In my case, I am using a self-created

death_method = exploding ; Make it explode on death

;trail = gf_continuous_damage ; I used this for debugging, so I could see where the explosion is going to happen. 
explosion = debris_missile_explosion ; Explosion that the debris will use when it dies.

;effect = explosion_super_flak ; I commented this out, but this system can be used on capital ships to create an ambient flak around capital ships.
