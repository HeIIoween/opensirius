The battledust system was devised so that a heated battle would build up dust and debris
almost to the point of causing a localized nebula. There are three different versions of
the ALE itself, so use whichever you believe is necessary. 

The system is very simple. Attached to every fighter munition is an explosion. This 
explosion then calls the battledust effect. It is a very effective and very simple system
provided you have have a macro set up to give it to every single munition. Do not use this
on missiles. In effect, each individual bullet contributes a cloud, and as the fights go 
on and ships get hit, this can create a large cloud over a large area. Its very neat to 
see. If you want to see an example of this, download the 88 Flak mod by foxUnit01.

Feel free to use and modify these. Please credit me in the readme of your
mod. I also ask that you send me a PM through The Starport, or e-mail me at 
bmh123@comcast.net to give me a heads up on its use.
