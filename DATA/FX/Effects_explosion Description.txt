The effects_explosion.ini file is here to show what code needs to be 
added to the effects_explosion.ini in order for the new ALEs to function. 
The weapon ALEs are all replacements of the ALEs included in vanilla 
Freelancer, so they require no new code, they work out of the box. 

To add the new explosion ALEs to your mod, you will need to copy the entry 
that is both in the effects_explosion.ini, and its corresponding entry in 
the \EXPLOSIONS\explosions_ale.ini file. Along with copying the actual ALE 
to the \EXPLOSIONS folder. If any one of these is missing, the effect will
not appear.

Feel free to use and modify these. Please credit me in the readme of your
mod. I also ask that you send me a PM through The Starport, or e-mail me at 
bmh123@comcast.net to give me a heads up on its use.
