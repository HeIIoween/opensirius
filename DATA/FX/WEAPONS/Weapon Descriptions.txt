Compared to the previous effects released on Starport, these have undergone
serious optimization with minimal loss to quality. I experienced a framerate
boost of 17 fps to 50 fps after I optimized these effects. 

Color code:

li_ = White/Blue
br_ = Blue
ku_ = Yellow
rh_ = Green
pi_ = Red 

All th effects in this folder are replacement ALEs for vanilla Freelancer 
and as such, they require no new code to use. Make sure you read the warning
regarding the new torpedo explosion below!

xx_missile01.ale

These are trails that are equivalent to the vanilla homing missile trails. 
They have no delay before ignition, and just like their vanilla 
counterparts, they are beam based rather than particle based.

Also note, the missile explosions included in this ALE have been adjusted
so that they no longer fly through the target. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

xx_missile02.ale

These trails are equivalent to the standard missiles used in vanilla. They
have about a second delay before the missile ignites. Before ignition it 
leaves a slight smoke trail, so even with tiny invisible missiles, it is
still visible. 

Also note, the missile explosions included in this ALE have been adjusted
so that they no longer fly through the target.

xx_empmissile.ale

These trails are very similar to the missile01 trails. They have a very
slight delay before ignition, and the trails are smaller as well. I included
these for completeness sake. In Itano Circus, they are used for the micro-
missiles. 

Also note, the missile explosions included in this ALE have been adjusted
so that they no longer fly through the target.

xx_torpedo01.ale

This is similar to the old torpedo effect previously released in that it is a
bright EVE light for the engine and a good smoke trail. Since the last release
the effect has now been reduced in size to a much more realistic leve. This 
effect also has a very long delay before ignition, 2 seconds.

WARNING! The explosion visual for this torpedo is MASSIVE. The explosions in 
this torpedo were originally intended for Itano Circus' Reaction Torpedoes, 
which are basically small nuclear weapons. When you are calling an explosion 
effect for your torpedoes, I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND you use the fighter explosions 
that are included in this pack. They are the correct size.

Feel free to use and modify these. Please credit me in the readme of your
mod. I also ask that you send me a PM through The Starport, or e-mail me at 
bmh123@comcast.net to give me a heads up on its use.
