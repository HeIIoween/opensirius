These two txm files are textures. The smoke.txm contains the new texture that 
the missile effects in this pack use for their volumetric looking smoke trails.
The standardeffects.txm contains a new explosion sprite. The smoke.txm will not
affect anything if it is present, other than providing the NEW textures needed
for the missile smokes. The standardeffects.txm however will replace the old 
explosion sprite. If you prefer the old explosion sprite, simply use the vanilla
version of the standardeffects.txm.

Feel free to use and modify these. Please credit me in the readme of your
mod. I also ask that you send me a PM through The Starport, or e-mail me at 
bmh123@comcast.net to give me a heads up on its use.
