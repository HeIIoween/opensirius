These missiles are basically just resized versions of their existing ones. I was 
actually completely unaware that missiles even used a model until I saw these. The
missiles are big enough so that they can actually be seen when launched now.

dummy_round

This is a special model I made that contains empty information. It does have an 
HPFire, so this can be used as an invisible round. It also has an HPMount and 
HPConnect so that it can be mounted and be used as an invisible gun. I use this 
for the ambient explosion system.

Feel free to use and modify these. Please credit me in the readme of your
mod. I also ask that you send me a PM through The Starport, or e-mail me at 
bmh123@comcast.net to give me a heads up on its use.
