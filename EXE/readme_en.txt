ENBoost 0.203 for Fallout 3 / New Vegas.

This is adaptation of code i did for TES Skyrim to reduce memory usage of the game
and to fix most CTDs (crashes to desktop) because of "out of memory" issue when many
mods installed. Don't know if this problem exist for Fallout games, but let it be,
if it's important, i'll add this to ENBSeries for Fallout, but now it's just a patch
without any changes to graphics. What it's doing? Utilize your videocard memory
much better, compress resources and send them to enbhost.exe process, so you can
install more mods with x64 OS (up to 4 gb game use by default and with this it's
max about 10 gb at this moment)
