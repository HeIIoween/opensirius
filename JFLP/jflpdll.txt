			    Jason's Freelancer Patch
				DLL Version 1.12


This documents describes the changes made to jflp.dll, released separately from
the patch.

Legend: * changed, - fixed, + added.

v1.12, 6 December, 2010.

+ If an equipment name contains a non-breaking space (Alt+0160), display "n/a"
  (not available) instead of the actual stats (extra stats only).

+ NS versions to remove the extra stats display altogether (No Stats).

- Improved widescreen support (fixed mouse sensitivity; fixed script view;
  fixed Alt+Tab with the Nav Map open).


v1.11, 22 October, 2009.

+ If MultiCruise is being used, include the cruise speed in the Engine stats.


v1.10, 3 October, 2009.

- Freelancer actually tests if the resolution is 4:3, so your widescreen desktop
  resolution still wouldn't show up in the list (originally put down to using an
  unsupported windowed resolution).

* Use En Dash instead of Hyphen-Minus for the trade lane arrow (and chat
  prompt).  I had intended to use an actual arrow, but the Agency FB font
  doesn't have it.  (Using the angle quotation mark worked well for the Nav Map,
  but not so good anywhere else, so the greater-than sign remains.)

+ Added 8-way strafing.  Allows simultaneous keypresses to strafe diagonally.

+ Put the sector letter first (as in "Sector C4").  (FL Hack can be used to
  restore the number first.)

+ JFLPAC.DLL provides an anti-cheat for cameras.ini.  It prevents fovx and fovy
  from changing the camera, always using the calculated fovx value (although
  fovx must still be present in cameras.ini).


v1.01, 22 September, 2009.

+ Allow roll to work during mouse flight.
